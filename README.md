# CRUD-Application

As a user, I can register for an account and sign in/out. (i.e. an account has a unique e-mail, password)

As a user, I can create new events (Events have a title, description, location)

As a user, I have a personal page that shows all the events

Personal Page - is a dashboard feature the above three components.

As a user, I can edit events

As a user, I can destroy events

As a user, I want to be able to add an event on the page that lists all my events. When that new event is created, it is appended to the list without the page refreshing.
